    # list of files to generate.

    # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.

    #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]

    #  - color_snake: Color of the snake

    #  - color_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.

    #                 The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
